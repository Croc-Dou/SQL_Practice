###Leetcode Database 

##Q1 combine two tables
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State FROM Person 
LEFT JOIN Address ON PErson.PersonId = Address.PersonId

#We are unable to use Where here because of the requirement 'regardless if there is an address for each of those people'
#regardless" means that if a person doesn't have a proper address in Address relation, it should also appear in the result with the city and state being null. Therefore, using only where can't fulfill this requirement


##Q2 Second highest salary
#if the second highest salary is not guaranteed to exist
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)

#If it is guaranteed, use limit offset method
#option2
SELECT DISTINCT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary From Employee
Order by Salary DESC
Limit 1 OFFSET 1
